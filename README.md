Examples for funnel chart using jqPlot and d3

1)  jqPlot - This was super simple to implement and customize appearance.  Takes an array of values and spits out the funnel.  Funnel is automatically ordered by highest to lowest whether your data is or not.  See /jqPlot/jqPlotFunnel.html

2)  d3 - This was just an experiment using d3 and a git user's plugin to do the funnel work for me.  This example was not as customizable as we would like, but does show basic abilities to do what we need via d3.
